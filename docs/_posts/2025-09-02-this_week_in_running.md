Whelp, here we are with another unplanned, yet sort-of structured week of aerobic base mileage build up. Shorter workouts than previous weeks, but a much spicier long run than what I've done in recent memory. Let's get into it:

# Monday

A run of the mill [7 mile run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15585914740) just to get the legs moving. Sub 70â„‰ weather at 5:20PM was much appreciated.

# Tuesday

Yet another cozy run at the beginning of the week with [ten miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/15599288646) featuring a vistit to my favorite trails in Leslie Science Park.

# Wednesday

A late start resulted in a [short workout](https://www.strava.com/activities/15611045776) of 7 x 800m on 60s rest. Reps were between 2:30 and 2:34; probably not long enough to get much work in at "sub-threshold", but I can tick the box of "moved quickly through a set of intervals" â˜‘.

# Thursday

The only double I was able to fit in this week, with an [easy 6.5](https://www.strava.com/activities/15616701931) in the morning and an [8 mile snack](https://www.strava.com/activities/15621278821) before dinner.

# Friday

For the first time in a long time, I set out to do a [tempo run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15631127732) in the form of one contiguous interval (5 miles). Or at least that was my intention; took 2.5 miles to find the right pace, but after that was able to cruise for the remainder. Total of 12.4 miles on the day with warm-up and cool-down.

# Saturday

[10 Lovely Miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/15638732076) at a cozy pace, with a fair bit of the mileage run on dirt and grass. Thankfully the Michigan - UNM game was an evening game, so I had plenty of time in the morning to run before things got too crazy.

# Sunday

Can you call it a [long run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15654408260) if the activity took less than 90 minutes? ðŸ¤”. 15 miles in 1:28 and change (5:53/mile average) at a "fast-but-controlled" effort. Felt the lactate in my legs running up Newport, but otherwise felt great. First time in recent memory of seeing little trophies on Strava segments as well.

And with the long run, I find myself with yet another ~75 mile week done mostly on singles. Hoping to get back above 80 next week with a few more double days, but we'll see what life allows me to fit in.
