Just a list of things that caught my attention over the past week. Some of these items still remain in my "to-read" list, while others were only skimmed.

## Papers

* [Multiancestry brain pQTL fine-mapping and integration with genome-wide association studies of 21 neurologic and psychiatric conditions](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02291-2)
    * I will be frank in admitting that I havn't been able to quite digest the methods they apply to results after identifying causal pQTLs, but I do find it interesting that a high proportion of these pQTLs do appear to be shared across ancestries
* [Incorporating Polygenic Liability and Family History for Predicting Psychiatric Diseases in the Taiwan Biobank](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.02.888)
    * Family history and PRS, which should share some information on the contribution of genetic factors to disease risk, appear to have complimentary information, with models that include both outperforming those accounting for only one of the two.
        * I buy into the argument that family history will also capture aspects of the influence of a shared environment on disease risk, along with the contribution of rare genetic variation that might not be accounted for in a PRS. Is there other information that can be gleamed from insurance registries that would allow for better accounting for environmental factors that influence disease risk?
* [Robust and accurate Bayesian inference of genome-wide genealogies for hundreds of genomes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02317-9)
* [Genome-wide iterative fine-mapping for non-Gaussian phenotypes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09270-x)
* [Assessment of ability of a DNA language model to predict pathogenicity of rare coding variants](https://doi.org/10.1038/s10038-025-01385-3)
* [Harnessing functional annotation to improve the accuracy and transferability of polygenic scores](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-025-00893-4)
