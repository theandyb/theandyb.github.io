This week was a continuation of my current plan of "let's build an aerobic base before transitioning to marathon training at the end of the year". Cooler temperatures have begun to creep in, but still plenty of hot runs to keep the heat adaptations sharp.

# Monday

[9 miles in just over an hour](https://www.strava.com/activities/15506301873). 6:41/mile average pace, so not too hard, but can't really call it an easy run per say

# Tuesday

[10 easy miles in the greatest route I've ever constructed](https://www.strava.com/activities/15518576371). Who says you need to venture far from home to hit double-digit mileage?

# Wednesday

An [AM 6.5 mile long shakeout](https://www.strava.com/activities/15523290765) followed by my [first attempt of a Mona Fartlek](https://www.strava.com/activities/15530200272) in the evening. The Mona Fartlek is named after [Steve Moneghetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Moneghetti), and is a structured farlek consisting of time based intervals 2 x (90s on / 90s float), 4 x (60s on / 60s float), 4 x (30s on / 30s float), 4 x (15s on / 15s float). Was a bit of a struggle for me, but had fun nonetheless (15s floats are cruelly short after all-out efforts).

# Thursday

Off. Don't take off days every week; just happened to workout that both this and last week Thursday were too busy to fit in runs. Somehow, I'll survive.

# Friday

A visit to the track for some [sub-threshold intervals](https://sites.google.com/view/sub-threshold/home). After a [5km progressive warm up](https://www.strava.com/activities/15552135794), ran a mix of [1000 and 2000m repeats](https://www.strava.com/activities/15552135938) on ~60s rest. Mixed up the interval distances to keep things interesting (and to force myself to slow down after starting too hot).

# Saturday

[Another nice run through the Pioneer trails](https://www.strava.com/activities/15563425491). ALMOST kept the pace slower than 7:00min/mile for the entire run.

# Sunday

[A fun medium-long run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15571959418) of 20km with 3x(3km on, 1km off) in the middle. Final 4km wer predominantly downhill, so was almost as fast as the workout portion of the run.

Followed up the morning's session with [an easy 8](https://www.strava.com/activities/15575409598) with a good chunk on grass, to wrap up with 20 miles on the day and 75 miles on the week. 17 miles more than last week, which was down from 75 the week prior. Looking forward to doubling more consistently in the next week, while also adding distance to my weekend "long" run (I'm thinking 25km at an easy-to-moderate pace).
