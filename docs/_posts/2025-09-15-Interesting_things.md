Getting ahead of things this week and making a post on Monday that I can add to at my leisure (as opposed to racking my brain on Sunday trying to recall every cool thing that popped up over the week).

## Papers 

* [Applying weighted Cox regression to genome-wide association studies of time-to-event phenotypes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-025-00864-z)
    * In my quest to [understand Survival Analysis](/2025-09-06-brushing_up_on_survival), one of the questions I'm interested in addressing is: "how are surival time outcomes modeled with genetic data?". Well, here's a method paper in the topic area!
