Of all the [Andy Becks](https://www.google.com/search?q=Andy%20Beck) in the world, this Andy Beck is currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/index.html) at the University of Michigan. His research interests lie in the intersection of statistical genetics, population genetics, and genomics. In particular, he has been interested in addressing the questions

- How does genomic context influence germline mutation rates, and how can we use GWAS data from studies of unrelated individuals to study these?
- How can we benchmark modern statistical phasing algorithms in terms of phasing errors? Can we train models to identify locations where a phasing error is more likely to occur?

Prior to entering the PhD program, Andy earned a BS in Mathematics (2013) and Masters in Applied Statistics (2014) from [Loyola University Chicago](https://luc.edu), and a Masters in Biostatistics (2016) from the University of Michigan. Between 2016 and 2018, Andy worked as a software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, WI.
